const admin = require("firebase-admin");
const serviceAccount = require("./service-account.json"); 

// Initialize App (Mocking the environment or using default if avail)
// Since we are running in a context where we might not have the key file handy, 
// let's assume we can use the 'firebase-admin' already initialized via 'firebase functions:shell' 
// BUT we can't run that easily here.

// ALTERNATIVE: Use the Frontend SDK (firebase.js) to query.
// This is much easier as we have the config.
// formatting as a node script using 'firebase' package (not admin)

// We need to require the firebase deps.
// Run this with `node debug_venue.js` in the `src` folder (might fail due to ESM)
// Actually, let's just write the code I would WANT the user to run in their browser console.
// That is the most reliable way.

/*
// COPY PASTE THIS INTO BROWSER CONSOLE ON LANDING PAGE
import { db } from './firebase'; // This won't work in console directly.

// We need to rely on the user or use the `run_command` to execute a script.
// I will try to use `firebase-admin` with a script in `functions` folder since that has the deps?
// But it needs creds.
*/

// Let's try to find the credentials file.
